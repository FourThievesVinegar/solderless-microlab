  intro: |
    This is a [PartCAD](https://partcad.org/) package for MicroLab.
    It is intended to maintain the information about all the parts
    for the following purposes: manufacturing, procurement and assembly
    (both manual and automated assembly instructions).

    *DISCLAIMER: PartCAD is still under heavy development, and so is
    the PartCAD package for Microlab. Please, consider contributing to
    both PartCAD and this package, but do not yet use this package
    for manufacturing or ordering Microlab parts.*
