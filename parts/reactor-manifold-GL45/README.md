# GL45 Variant Reactor Core

This design uses a borosilicate media bottle with GL45 threads as the inner vessel and a hand-cut teflon disk as the lid to improve chemical compatibility. Because the sealing surface is the bottom of the teflon disk, not the edges, tight tolerances are not required.

Reactor Core parts list:

- Outer Jar and lid ring
- Inner 250ml GL45 borosilicate bottle
- Printed Reactor Core
- Carved PTFE Disc
- PTFE stirrer
- Shaft coupler.
- Motor with barrel plug attached

Refer to [the parts list](https://github.com/FourThievesVinegar/solderless-microlab/raw/refs/heads/main/docs/microlab-parts-list.xlsx) for exact specifications and notes.

## PTFE Disc

The disc itself is approximately 35mm in diameter. The stirrer in the parts list requires a central hole approximately 8mm in diameter. The reagent pump tubes have an outside diameter of 10mm. While it is possible to drill PTFE, it is much easier to work it with a knife.
