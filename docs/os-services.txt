==========================
Welcome!
==========================

This document explains how the MicroLab interfaces with the Linux OS it runs on. To get to a terminal, plug in a keyboard, hit ctrl + alt + F6 ( or F5, F4, etc), and log in as `thief` pw: `vinegard`.

In this file:
- Configurations for the MicroLab services (API, web server, and browser)
- Other file locations

==========================
Where the services live
==========================

In the following directory there are two services defined:
```
/home/thief/.config/systemd/user
```

they are:
```
microlab-serve.service       # Starts the webserver for the GUI
microlab-browser.service     # Starts the browser for the GUI
```

Additionally, in the directory
```
/usr/lib/systemd/system
```

There is one file for the backend service:
```
microlab.service           # Starts the python backend
```

===========================
Other file locations
===========================

There are other file locations to take note of:

```
/etc/microlab/microlab.ini	# General configuration file

/var/lib/microlab		# Hardware configurations and recipes live here
/var/log/microlab		# The log files live here
```

Note that the latter two directories can be configured in the `microlab.ini` config file.
