# MicroLab Reactor Unit Assembly

These instructions assume you have already assembled the Pumps Unit and the Reactor Core.

## Parts

### Purchased Parts

- 20x 12mm M3 screws
  - These are only necessary for the older version - the new version uses tabs and slots
- A 12v light with a male barrel connector plug (or other 12v device of your choosing, this is an auxiliary feature that can be extended to serve other purposes!)

### Printed Parts

- All Reactor Stand pieces: H A ¢ k
  - Take care to make sure that you have removed all excess material from the tabs and slots if you are using the new tab-and-slot version.
  - If the tabs get stuck in the slots, the parts may break. You can use glue to re-attach them, but better not to.
  - Test fit using gentle pressure. The pieces should fit easily and snugly together. If they require much effort, consider using a knife to trim more material. The necessity of this will depend on your printer and its settings.
- Jar flange(s) as needed (thin c-shaped pieces used to hold the Reactor Core more securely)

## Assembling the Stand

**Components:**

- All Reactor Stand pieces: H A ¢ k

**Assembly:**

- Use the tabs and slots (or M3 screws) to assemble the Reactor Stand pieces in the following way:
  - The H is the left side.
  - The k is the right side.
  - The A connects them along the back.
  - Together, the H A k units support the ¢ and the Pumps Unit.

## Assembling the Rest of the Fucking Reactor

You've already built the core and the pump. All that's left to do is connect it all up.

**Components:**

- The Reactor Stand
- The Reactor Core
- The Pumps Unit
- Reactor Core shim(s) - probably 2x for the screwed version.
- A 12v light with a male barrel connector plug

**Assembly:**

- Plug the large inward-pointing tabs on the H and k into the side slots on the pumps unit.
  - In the screwed version, H and k each have four holes that match up with the holes on the Pumps Unit.
  - Note that putting nuts on these screws will require opening the Pumps Unit.
- Plug the large tab on the back of the ¢ into the slot on the front of the Pumps Unit and slide the other tabs on the ¢ into the slots on the H and k.
- Check that everything feels stable. You may want to use a long velcro strap to secure the Pumps Unit 
- Place the reactor core in the center of the ¢. If it feels loose, place shim(s) between the top of the ¢ and the underside of the rim on the neck of the Reactor Core's outer jar.
- Plug the stirring motor's plug into the upper barrel connector socket.
- Plug the light's plug into the barrel connector socket on the underside of the ¢.
  - We used self-adhesive 12v light strips, but attaching the barrel plug connector to that requires soldering. Any 12v device powered by a male barrel plug connector will work. If you have recommendations for additions, we are open to suggestions in an email or github issue.
  - We also recommend velcroing the light(s) to the under-side of the ¢ so they can be removed for packing and storage.
- Connect the peristaltic pumps to the Reactor Core manifold's inner channels using appropriate tubing.
  - For more on this, see [MicroLab Operation](/docs/operation.md).
