Microlab by Four Thieves Vinegar Collective.

This is a [PartCAD](https://partcad.org/) package for MicroLab.
It is intended to maintain the information about all the parts
for the following purposes: manufacturing, procurement and assembly
(both manual and automated assembly instructions).

*DISCLAIMER: PartCAD is still under heavy development, and so is
the PartCAD package for Microlab. Please, consider contributing to
both PartCAD and this package, but do not yet use this package
for manufacturing or ordering Microlab parts.*
