    # We currently recommend printing with PETG rather than PLA, which can only reach ~60C before
    # it begins to mechanically fail (95C for PETG). If you print with a different material,
    # this may be increased, search for the glass transition temperature for your material.
    # Water of course also boils at 100C, and will slowly boil off somewhat below that
    # so consider something like Propylene Glycol instead of water as a heat exchanger fluid.
    # Also keep in mind the recommended thermometer (DS18S20) only supports -55 to 125C.
